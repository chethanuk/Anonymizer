NeMo Anonymizer detects and protects PII through context-aware replacement and rewriting. It offers high-quality user-guided entity detection, followed by modification options that maintain context while inducing privacy. You can review what sensitive information was found, adjust your masking strategy, and generate anonymized text.

# Get Started

## Install

```bash
pip install nemo-anonymizer
```
## Setup

```bash
# Get an API key from OpenRouter
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
```
By default, Anonymizer runs GLiNER2 detection locally and uses OpenRouter for LLM-based anonymization. You can also [bring your own models](concepts/models.md).

!!! warning "Review the default provider's data policies"

    OpenRouter's terms of service and privacy practices apply independently of the NeMo Framework
    library. Review those terms and the data policies of the models you select before sending
    sensitive data to the default endpoint.

!!! info "Record length"

    Records up to 2,000 tokens each work with the default model configs. Longer text will require adjustment of model providers and model configs.

## Anonymize

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from anonymizer import Anonymizer, AnonymizerConfig, AnonymizerInput, Substitute

    input_data = AnonymizerInput(
        source="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Anonymizer/refs/heads/main/docs/data/NVIDIA_synthetic_biographies.csv",
        text_column="biography",
        data_summary="Biographical profiles of individuals",
    )
    anonymizer = Anonymizer()
    config = AnonymizerConfig(replace=Substitute())

    anonymizer.validate_config(config)

    preview = anonymizer.preview(
        config=config,
        data=input_data,
        num_records=5,
    )
    preview.display_record()

    # Inspect the preview, adjust parameters if needed, then run full data.
    output = anonymizer.run(
        config=config,
        data=input_data,
    )
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    # Preview a few rows first
    anonymizer preview \
      --source "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Anonymizer/refs/heads/main/docs/data/NVIDIA_synthetic_biographies.csv" \
      --text-column biography \
      --data-summary "Biographical profiles of individuals" \
      --replace substitute \
      --num-records 5

    # Then run the full dataset
    anonymizer run \
      --source "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Anonymizer/refs/heads/main/docs/data/NVIDIA_synthetic_biographies.csv" \
      --text-column biography \
      --data-summary "Biographical profiles of individuals" \
      --replace substitute \
      --output biographies_anonymized.csv
    ```

!!! note "`data_summary` improves detection"

    `data_summary` is optional but recommended for domain-specific data. It helps the LLM find more entities and reduce false drops.

## Language And Regional Coverage

Anonymizer has been tested most extensively on English-language data. Multilingual quality has not yet been evaluated systematically across languages, domains, and models.

Although testing so far has been primarily in English, the supported entity set is not limited to U.S.-specific identifiers. Detection and anonymization can also apply to international formats such as non-U.S. phone numbers, addresses, legal references, and national or regional identification numbers, though coverage will vary by language, region, and model configuration.

If you are working with another language, we encourage you to experiment on a small sample first with `preview()`, validate detected entities and transformed output carefully, and adjust your [model providers and model configs](concepts/models.md) as needed.

## Inspect
View an interactive visualization with entity highlights.
```python
preview.display_record()
```
Access the main results -- original text, entities, and transformed text.
```python
preview.dataframe
```
Access the full pipeline trace with all internal columns.
```python
preview.trace_dataframe
```
Save a full run and load it back later, for example to pass it to `anonymizer.evaluate()`.
```python
from anonymizer.interface.results import AnonymizerResult

output.write_artifacts("run_artifacts")
loaded = AnonymizerResult.read_artifacts("run_artifacts")
```
The directory holds the result and trace as Parquet, the failed records, and a versioned `metadata.json` with the strategy and evaluation inputs.

## Telemetry and Privacy

NeMo Anonymizer includes an optional function to share anonymous run-level telemetry with NVIDIA for product improvement. One event is emitted per `Anonymizer.run()` / `Anonymizer.preview()` invocation and contains only technical metadata:

- **Run outcome** — final task status (`completed` / `error` / `canceled`) and wall-clock duration
- **Pipeline configuration** — transformation type (`annotate`, `redact`, `hash`, `substitute`, `rewrite`), whether `data_summary` / `privacy_goal` / `Substitute(instructions=...)` were customized, `max_repair_iterations`, `strict_entity_protection`
- **Models used per step** — model aliases for the detector, validator, augmenter, rewriter, etc. (whichever steps ran in this mode)
- **Model hosts** — coarse classification of the inference endpoints used (`nvidia-build`, `nvidia-internal`, `openrouter`, `local`, `other`)
- **Aggregate counts** — number of input records, success and failure counts, average tokens per record (estimated with `tiktoken cl100k_base`), and failure attribution by pipeline workflow
- **Deployment type** — `sdk` or `cli`

**No user data, record contents, prompts, model outputs, or device information are collected.** Aggregate usage data (such as which models are most popular) will be shared back with the community; it is not used to track any individual user behavior.

You may opt out of telemetry collection at any time. Opting out applies only to data collection by NeMo Anonymizer itself.

To disable telemetry in the SDK, set `emit_telemetry=False` on `AnonymizerConfig`:

```python
config = AnonymizerConfig(replace=Redact(), emit_telemetry=False)
```

To disable telemetry for one CLI invocation, pass `--no-emit-telemetry`:

```bash
uv run anonymizer run --source data.csv --text-column text --replace redact --no-emit-telemetry
```

To disable telemetry for the current shell, set `NEMO_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` (other accepted disabling values: `0`, `no`) in your environment before running:

```bash
export NEMO_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

**Use of third-party endpoints, including OpenRouter and NVIDIA Build:** Anonymizer can be configured to use various inference endpoints, including [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com), or local model servers. If you choose to use a third-party endpoint, that endpoint's own terms of service and privacy practices apply independently of this library. Any opt-out you exercise within Anonymizer does not extend to data collection by your chosen endpoint.

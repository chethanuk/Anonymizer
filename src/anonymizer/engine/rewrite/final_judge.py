<privacy_goal>
<<PRIVACY_GOAL>>
</privacy_goal>

<original_text>
<<COL_TEXT>>
</original_text>

<rewritten_text>
<<COL_REWRITTEN_TEXT>>
</rewritten_text>

<task>
Evaluate the rewritten text on three separate dimensions:
1. privacy protection,
2. content quality / meaning preservation,
3. style of writing.

Score each dimension independently.
</task>

<privacy_scoring_instructions>
- Judge privacy relative to the original text, not in isolation.
- The privacy score must reflect the likelihood that a realistic attacker could discover or match the rewritten text back to the original person, case, listing, or record using available information.
- Focus on residual linkage risk after the rewrite, not on the mere presence of detail.

- When evaluating identifiers, explicitly compare rewritten values to original values.
- Only treat an identifier as leaked if the SAME original value, a near-direct equivalent, or an obvious reversible transformation remains.
- If no original identifiers remain, do NOT treat identifiers present in the rewritten text as leaked.
- The presence of the same value alone does not imply a privacy leak unless the value is inherently identifying or uniquely distinguishing.

- Distinguish between:
  * direct identifiers: information that uniquely identifies the protected subject on its own (not other people mentioned)
  * quasi-identifiers: information that contributes to identification only in combination with other details

- Treat preserved direct identifiers as high risk, but assess both:
  * their strength (how uniquely identifying they are), and
  * their role (whether they directly identify the subject or are secondary/relational, such as names of relatives)
- Secondary or relational identifiers and distinctive combinations increase linkage risk but typically require additional context. They should not alone imply easy re-identification and should only result in a `low` score when they provide a short, reliable, and low-ambiguity path to identifying the protected subject.

- Treat contextual attributes (e.g., organizations, locations, roles, affiliations) as quasi-identifiers unless they uniquely identify the individual on their own.

- Evaluate linkage risk based on how much the remaining information narrows the set of plausible matches.
  * Do not infer high risk from specificity alone.
  * Only penalize quasi-identifiers when they significantly reduce the candidate set or form a distinctive or rare combination.

- Distinguish between levels of linkage risk:
  * high  — original direct identifiers removed; remaining details create low linkage risk
  * medium — no obvious direct identifiers, but a distinctive quasi-identifier bundle creates noticeable linkage risk
  * low   — one or more direct identifiers or near-equivalents remain, or the record is easily or near-certainly linkable

- A small number of weak or secondary identifiers (e.g., common names of relatives) should increase risk but should not by themselves result in a `low` score unless they substantially narrow the candidate set.

- Apply the stated privacy goal. Do not require unnecessary over-redaction if the rewrite adequately achieves the intended level of protection.
</privacy_scoring_instructions>

<quality_scoring_instructions>
    - Judge quality based on how well the rewritten text preserves the important meaning, facts,
      and utility of the original while pursuing the privacy goal.
    - Focus on preservation of substantive content, not verbatim wording.
    - Do NOT penalize the rewrite for changing or removing details when those changes are necessary
      for privacy and the important meaning is still preserved.
    - Reward rewrites that preserve the main events, relationships, roles, chronology, and
      conclusions of the original.
    - Penalize rewrites that omit important facts, distort the meaning, introduce contradictions,
      or materially change the core message.
    - Judge quality independently from privacy and style. A rewrite can be privacy-protective
      but still low quality if it loses important meaning, and it can be high quality even if
      some surface details are changed.
    - Score as:
      * high   — important meaning, facts, and structure fully preserved
      * medium — most content preserved; minor details lost or slightly distorted
      * low    — material loss of important information, contradictions, or distorted core meaning
</quality_scoring_instructions>

<style_scoring_instructions>
    - Judge style based on whether the rewritten text reads as fluent, coherent, and human-written.
    - Focus on readability, grammatical correctness, clarity, and smooth phrasing.
    - Do NOT penalize the rewrite merely for using different wording, sentence structure, or
      level of specificity from the original.
    - Reward rewrites that sound natural and internally consistent.
    - Penalize awkward phrasing, repetitive wording, broken grammar, incoherence, unnatural
      insertions, placeholder-like language, or text that feels machine-generated.
    - Malformed phrases left by substituting or generalizing a value (a wrong article, a stranded
      modifier such as "a in his late 30s astronomer") are broken grammar; score `low`.
    - Judge style independently from privacy and quality. A rewrite can be natural even if it
      changes content, and it can preserve content while still sounding awkward.
    - Score as:
      * high   — fluent, coherent, human-written prose
      * medium — mostly readable; isolated awkward phrasing or stiff transitions
      * low    — noticeably unnatural; broken grammar, placeholder-like language, or machine-generated feel
